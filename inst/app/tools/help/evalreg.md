#### Response variable

The numeric outcome, or response, variable of interest.

#### Predictor

Select one or more variables that can be used to _predict_ the value of the response variable. This could be a variable or predicted values from a model (e.g., from a regression estimated using _Model > Linear regression (OLS)_ or a Neural Network estimated using _Model > Neural Network (ANN)_).

#### Show results for

If a `filter` is active (e.g., set in the _Data > View_ tab) generate results for `All` data, `Training` data, `Validation` data, or `Both` training and validation data. If no filter is active calculations are applied to all data.

## Example

Predictions were derived from a linear regression and an neural network with two nodes in the hidden layer on the `diamonds` data. The variables `price` and `carat` were log-transformed prior to estimation.The data is available through the _Data > Manage_ tab (i.e., choose `Examples` from the `Load data of type` drop-down and press `Load examples`). The predictions shown below were generated in the _Predict_ tab.

The test statistics show a small, but consistent, advantage for the ANN.
